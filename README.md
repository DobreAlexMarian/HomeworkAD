This program is designed to solve a variation of the fractional knapsack problem, where the goal is to maximize the total value of lobsters that can be caught in a net with a given capacity. The lobsters have individual sizes and values, and the net can hold lobsters either entirely or partially based on its remaining capacity. Input the net's capacity and the number of lobsters. Input the size and value of each lobster. Calculate the efficiency (value/size) for each lobster. Sort lobsters based on their efficiency in descending order. Add lobsters to the net to maximize total value. Output the fraction or whole of each lobster added to the net. Display the total earnings from the lobsters caught. The program starts by collecting the net's capacity and the number of lobsters. For each lobster, it asks for the size and value. The program calculates the efficiency of each lobster, which is the value divided by the size. Lobsters are sorted in descending order of their efficiency to maximize the value added to the net. The program iterates through the sorted lobsters, adding them to the net until the net's capacity is exhausted. If a lobster can be added entirely, it is added fully. If only part of a lobster can be added due to remaining capacity, a fraction of it is added. For each lobster, the program prints whether it was added fully or partially. Finally, it prints the total earnings from the lobsters caught.
